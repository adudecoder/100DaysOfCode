### Geometric Art Generator
This code defines a pattern generator for a set of HTML elements. When the button is clicked or the page is loaded, it randomly selects shapes and colors from predefined sets and applies them to each element within a container. The shapes and colors are defined as arrays, and the generatePattern function sets the class and background color for each box based on random selections.❗️

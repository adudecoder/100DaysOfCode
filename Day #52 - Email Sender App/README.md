### Email Sender App
This JavaScript code integrates the EmailJS service to send emails directly from the user's browser.❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api keys (in video we showed how!) and replace it in script.js file on line 1 and 15 :

```javascript
emailjs.init("PUBLIC_KEY");
```
```javascript
emailjs.send("SERVICE_ID", "TEMPLATE_ID", {
```

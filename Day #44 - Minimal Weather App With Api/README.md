# Day #44

### Minimal Weather App
The code offers a weather forecast application with a simple user interface. Data is obtained from the OpenWeatherMap API and presented in a user-friendly way. The user can provide a personalized location, and weather details are displayed for the current day and the next four days.❗️

## Warning
You need to get your own api key (in video we showed how!) and replace it in index.js file on line 1 :

```javascript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
